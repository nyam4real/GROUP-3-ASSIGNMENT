My Experience so far at Code Plateau 1.0

Code Plateau 1.0 came at the right time for me. 
Just when i was about gearing up on learning coding, then the opportunity presented itself.Thank God i was selected.

My experience so far in this program can be summarily described as good and challenging. 

It is that of initial excitement for being selected and later on facing the challenge of time constraint as the classes advancanced.

Not withsatanding, i have come to accept the program with its challenges and hoping it will be improved upon with time.

As the saying goes, nothing good comes easy, challenges are bound to happen; as such i'm continuing with the program primarily for the fact that knowledge is being impacted.

My gratitude goes to the organisers and facilitors of this program for making this happen.
