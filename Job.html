My name is John Job Karsun (Group 3)
My Experience thus far
I love to think that I am a man of few words, so I will hope no one gets to read this.
Well, the first few days were pretty basic but intesting. I must say the tutors especially Nani are very patient.
All clases have been exciting some days more than others and like today 'fork' made the day.
And I made a few new friends.
That sums it up.
